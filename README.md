# Exploring Book Ratings and Prices — Web Scraping Project

This project focuses purely on **web scraping** book data from an online bookstore using Python’s `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` libraries.  
The scraped data includes **book titles, prices, and ratings**, which are saved into a CSV file for future analysis or exploration.

## ⚙️ How the Scraper Works

1. Sends a GET request to the website’s book listing pages using `requests`.  
2. Parses the HTML response using `BeautifulSoup`.  
3. Extracts:
   - **Title** – The book’s name.
   - **Price** – The listed price (including currency symbol).
   - **Rating** – The star rating (e.g., One, Two, Three, etc.).  
4. Stores each record in a list of dictionaries.  
5. Writes the final data into a CSV file named `books_scraped_data.csv`.
